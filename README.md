## GPT Eval

Evaluates the current block under the cursor as a question / answer pair. Eg:

```
-- What's the capitol of California
The capitol is Sacremento
```

Can be used in combination with another code block evaluator to build a simple notebook with GPT assistance.

eg:

```python
import os
import json

# load file 'data.json' and parse 
os. 

```
